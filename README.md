# Rating-Forecast-R-Shiny-App

The Rating Forecast is a customizable user-input interface to forecast the review rating of applications given select improvements are made. 

This project was most interesting to me by way of analyzing the number of "stars" that contribute to the overall rating of the application. From analysis on the top "issues" within a given application, we have the ability to forecast future ratings given these issues have been addressed. The combination of user inputs, which include text boxes and slide bars with given contraints, provide the necessary parameters for a detailed graphic which make the Shiny App a powerful tool for future forecasting. Within the parameters of the forecast a unique algorithm was created to receive the user inputs and provide a reasonable prediction for future results.
